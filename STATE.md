# MiniDB — STATE

A SQL database engine built as a conformance project, scored against **real SQLite**.
Governance, ladder, decisions, and score live here. Updated after every milestone.

**Score line format — every milestone report must include one:**

```
SCORE <tier>.<n>: <passed>/<total> (<pct>%) [Δ <sign><change> vs <last reported milestone>]
```

## Pinned reference

- **SQLite 3.54.0** (2026-10-09, the machine's `sqlite3`). All conformance numbers are
  against this version and only this version.
- If the reference version ever changes, this file records: old version, old score, new
  version, re-baselined score — in one entry. Scores across versions are not comparable.

## Ratified decisions (2026-10-30)

1. **Reference behavior is pinned SQLite, quirks included** (`1 IN ()`, dynamic typing,
   and friends). Our opinions about SQL correctness are irrelevant to the score.
2. **Not-yet-implemented = failed, always.** A test leaves the report only as a logged
   *known divergence* (a consciously accepted behavioral divergence from SQLite, named
   here). Excluded tests stay in the denominator. Skips that hide missing features are
   rejected in review.
3. **Result normalization is harness-owned.** Row ordering, float formatting, NULL
   rendering — normalized identically on both sides, in a file owned by Research. Build
   never edits it. *Default amendment:* any normalization change must re-run the corpus
   and report the before/after score delta in the same entry, so historical scores stay
   comparable when the normalizer moves.
4. **Raw test output in reports**, not summaries. Failures are reported as failures,
   never quietly patched and passed.

## Governance

- Roles: **Research** — specs, corpus, fuzzer, benchmarks; never engine code.
  **Build** — one milestone at a time, runs tests after each; never changes scope.
  **Default** — plans, backlog, ordering, review, budget; never engine code.
- Tier order is fixed by the ladder. A tier starts only when the previous gate is met
  and Steven approved the checkpoint.
- Within a tier, Default orders milestones, preferring whichever unblocks the most
  failing tests.
- Checkpoint every 3 milestones: score line + failures + next steps, then wait for
  Steven's approval.
- Budget per tier, owned by Default; warn before exceeding, stop and ask at the cap.

## Ladder

**TIER 1 — Foundations** · gate: 90% of basic conformance suite
1. SQL subset parser (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, WHERE)
2. In-memory tables
3. Disk storage with B-tree
4. Indexes
5. Query planner (index vs full scan)
6. Transactions
7. Write-ahead log and crash recovery
8. Joins, aggregates, subqueries
9. Fuzzing against SQLite

**TIER 2 — Real SQL coverage** · gate: 95% conformance, <1 fuzzer mismatch / 10k queries
10–17: expression engine; built-in functions; ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET/DISTINCT/GROUP BY/HAVING;
UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT; views & CTEs (recursive); window functions; ALTER TABLE, constraints,
foreign keys, triggers; collations & type affinity

**TIER 3 — Storage engine depth** · gate: benchmark queries within agreed multiple of
SQLite's speed, identical output (Default sets the multiple after first measurement)
18–23: page cache with eviction; free-space management & vacuum; overflow pages; cost-based
planner with statistics (ANALYZE); covering/partial/multi-column indexes; open real SQLite
files (format compatibility)

**TIER 4 — Reliability and concurrency** · gate: 10,000 random crashes, zero data loss
24–28: crash torture; snapshot isolation (concurrent readers, one writer); locking &
deadlocks; per-page checksums & integrity check; property-based testing

**TIER 5 — Usability and ecosystem** · gate: docs examples all pass; clean-machine install
29–33: CLI shell; network server; language bindings; EXPLAIN; verified documentation

**TIER 6 — Stretch:** full-text search; JSON functions; replication; planner learning from
query history; hot-path rewrite in a faster language

## Current state

- **Current milestone: 1 — SQL subset parser (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, WHERE). Owner:
  Build. Status: not started.**
- Score: `SCORE t1: corpus not pinned yet (0 runs) — baseline pending Research's corpus
  deliverable`
- Tier-1 budget: **12 team rounds** (a round = one message per role). Used: 0. **Warn at 9.**
  Checkpoint reviews don't count against the budget.
- Language call (Default, revisitable at the Tier-3 gate): **Python, stdlib-first**, for
  tiers 1–2 — fastest conformance iteration, and the hot-path rewrite is milestone 38 by
  design. Build confirms at M1 kickoff or says why not.

## Next three tasks

1. [Build] M1 parser — CREATE TABLE / INSERT / SELECT with WHERE; conformance numbers from
   the pinned corpus subset as soon as Research delivers it.
2. [Research] Deliver the pinned corpus subset + runner spec + normalization rules (first
   harness files; the score's denominator).
3. [Build] M2 in-memory tables, once M1 lands with numbers.

## Known failures

- none yet

## Known divergences

- none yet

## Decision log

- 2026-10-30: Project chartered by Steven. Decisions 1–4 ratified by Default (with the
  normalization-delta amendment in #3). Tier-1 budget: 12 rounds. Reference pinned to
  SQLite 3.54.0. Milestone 1 ordered.
