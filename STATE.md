# MiniDB — STATE

A SQL database engine built as a conformance project, scored against **real SQLite**.
Governance, ladder, decisions, and score live here. Updated after every milestone.

**Score line format — every milestone report must include one:**

```
SCORE <tier>.<n>: <passed>/<total> (<pct>%) [Δ <sign><change> vs <last reported milestone>]
```

## Pinned reference

- **SQLite 3.54.0** (2026-10-09, the machine's `sqlite3`). All conformance numbers are
  against this version and only this version.
- If the reference version ever changes, this file records: old version, old score, new
  version, re-baselined score — in one entry. Scores across versions are not comparable.

## Ratified decisions (2026-10-30)

1. **Reference behavior is pinned SQLite, quirks included** (`1 IN ()`, dynamic typing,
   and friends). Our opinions about SQL correctness are irrelevant to the score.
2. **Not-yet-implemented = failed, always.** A test leaves the report only as a logged
   *known divergence* (a consciously accepted behavioral divergence from SQLite, named
   here). Excluded tests stay in the denominator. Skips that hide missing features are
   rejected in review.
3. **Result normalization is harness-owned.** Row ordering, float formatting, NULL
   rendering — normalized identically on both sides, in a file owned by Research. Build
   never edits it. *Default amendment:* any normalization change must re-run the corpus
   and report the before/after score delta in the same entry, so historical scores stay
   comparable when the normalizer moves.
4. **Raw test output in reports**, not summaries. Failures are reported as failures,
   never quietly patched and passed.

## Governance

- Roles: **Research** — specs, corpus, fuzzer, benchmarks; never engine code.
  **Build** — one milestone at a time, runs tests after each; never changes scope.
  **Default** — plans, backlog, ordering, review, budget; never engine code.
- Tier order is fixed by the ladder. A tier starts only when the previous gate is met
  and Steven approved the checkpoint.
- Within a tier, Default orders milestones, preferring whichever unblocks the most
  failing tests.
- Checkpoint every 3 milestones: score line + failures + next steps, then wait for
  Steven's approval.
- Budget per tier, owned by Default; warn before exceeding, stop and ask at the cap.

## Ladder

**TIER 1 — Foundations** · gate: 90% of basic conformance suite
1. SQL subset parser (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, WHERE)
2. In-memory tables
3. Disk storage with B-tree
4. Indexes
5. Query planner (index vs full scan)
6. Transactions
7. Write-ahead log and crash recovery
8. Joins, aggregates, subqueries
9. Fuzzing against SQLite

**TIER 2 — Real SQL coverage** · gate: 95% conformance, <1 fuzzer mismatch / 10k queries
10–17: expression engine; built-in functions; ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET/DISTINCT/GROUP BY/HAVING;
UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT; views & CTEs (recursive); window functions; ALTER TABLE, constraints,
foreign keys, triggers; collations & type affinity

**TIER 3 — Storage engine depth** · gate: benchmark queries within agreed multiple of
SQLite's speed, identical output (Default sets the multiple after first measurement)
18–23: page cache with eviction; free-space management & vacuum; overflow pages; cost-based
planner with statistics (ANALYZE); covering/partial/multi-column indexes; open real SQLite
files (format compatibility)

**TIER 4 — Reliability and concurrency** · gate: 10,000 random crashes, zero data loss
24–28: crash torture; snapshot isolation (concurrent readers, one writer); locking &
deadlocks; per-page checksums & integrity check; property-based testing

**TIER 5 — Usability and ecosystem** · gate: docs examples all pass; clean-machine install
29–33: CLI shell; network server; language bindings; EXPLAIN; verified documentation

**TIER 6 — Stretch:** full-text search; JSON functions; replication; planner learning from
query history; hot-path rewrite in a faster language

## Current state

- **Current milestone: M4 — indexes (M3 accepted 2026-10-30). Acceptance rider: any
  "index works" claim needs a plan-level artifact; the score alone cannot prove index
  choice (spec: what the corpus cannot observe).**
- Scores (all cold-clone-reproduced by Default):
  - `SCORE t1.1: syntax 46/46 (100.0%) [Δ baseline — first measurement]`
  - `SCORE t1.2: behaviour 21/21 (100.0%) [Δ +21 vs M1]`, `syntax 46/46 (100.0%) [Δ +0]`
  - `SCORE t1.2 (re-baselined): 35/41 (85.4%) [Δ −6 vs pre-corpus 21/21 behaviour; +20
    cases]` — corpus `behavior.txt (21) + t1a.txt (20)`, corpus revision f12cee8
  - `SCORE t1.2.5: 39/41 (95.1%) [Δ +4 vs re-baselined 35/41]` — syntax unregressed
    (46/46), 94 unit tests OK, corpus revision f12cee8, reference SQLite 3.54.0.
  - **`SCORE t1.2.5 (re-baselined #2): 41/43 (95.3%) [Δ +2 cases, engine unchanged]`** —
    old score on old corpus: 39/41 (95.1%) at corpus revision f12cee8; new score on new
    corpus: 41/43 (95.3%) at 1c24177. Cases added: 2 (bracket/backtick quote-style).
    **Engine unchanged, no code diff — the +0.2pp is pure corpus growth, not progress.**
  - `SCORE t1.3 (M3): 41/43 (95.3%) [Δ +0 — expected; the corpus cannot observe
    persistence]` — durability is evidenced separately, not scored: `tools/
    durability_check.py` (Default re-ran from cold clone: write/reopen sha256 identical,
    append-after-reopen persisted; plus Default's own probe — CHECK constraint enforced
    identically after reopen). Syntax 46/46, 114 unit tests OK, corpus revision 1c24177
    (engine-only commits, correctly unchanged).
  The pre-corpus 100% measured a corpus that hadn't asked the hard questions yet; the
  honest trajectory is 35/41 → 39/41 and Tier-1's gate is 90% of the conformance suite.
- Tier-1 budget: **12 team rounds** (a round = one message per role). Used: 10. **WARN —
  cap forecast at M4's review.** Counting rule (Default, ruled at M3): a milestone is one
  round regardless of commit count; checkpoint reviews exempt. M4 build = round 11,
  M4 review = round 12 → Default stops and asks Steven to top up before that review.
  M3 capped at 2 rounds by Default; if page-format decisions would cost more, Default
  flags before spending.
- Language: **Python, stdlib-first** — confirmed by Build at M1. Revisited at the Tier-3
  gate as planned (hot-path rewrite is M38).
- Reference caveat: box Python `sqlite3` module is 3.53.1; the harness deliberately shells
  out to the `sqlite3` CLI (3.54.0 = pinned). The pin lives in `tools/syntax_conformance.py`
  (`PINNED = "3.54.0"`) **and** here — change both together; the tool prints `*** PINNED IS
  ***` when the CLI drifts from the pin.

## Next three tasks

1. [Build] M4 — indexes (ordered). Acceptance: corpus re-run raw output, syntax
   unregressed, uniqueness checks no longer full-scan (M3 limit), and the plan-level
   artifact rider.
2. [Build] M5 — query planner (index vs full scan), after M4 lands with numbers.
3. [Research] t1b tranche + `--reopen` directive implementation, lands after M5 —
   as its own reviewed runner change, not bolted onto M4.

## Known failures

- `SELECT 1` (no FROM) is valid SQLite; our parser rejects it — in Research's t1a corpus
  (cases 4–5, now erroring `incomplete input` in SQLite's wording); **expected to fail**
  until implemented. M10.
- No type affinity — `'5'` into an INTEGER column stores text. M17.
- Arithmetic in expressions (`a + 1 > 2`, `id + 1`) unparsed. M10.
- No ORDER BY / LIMIT / OFFSET / DISTINCT / GROUP BY / HAVING. M12.
- No DELETE / UPDATE / DROP; table-level `CHECK` rejected. M16.
- No joins or aggregates. M8.
- Column DEFAULT evaluated without SQLite's constant-expression rules — untested against
  quirks, flagged rather than assumed correct.
- No crash safety: writes are write-through, fsync only on clean close — M7 (WAL) owns.
- Rows larger than a page raise `row too large` — M20 (overflow pages) owns.
- Uniqueness checks scan the whole table — M4 (indexes) owns closing this.

## Known divergences

- none yet

## Decision log

- 2026-10-30: Project chartered by Steven. Decisions 1–4 ratified by Default (with the
  normalization-delta amendment in #3). Tier-1 budget: 12 rounds. Reference pinned to
  SQLite 3.54.0. Milestone 1 ordered.
- 2026-10-30 (later): M1 **accepted** after Default's independent cold-clone review (57
  tests OK, score line reproduced, version guard and error-classification logic read and
  confirmed sound). Python stdlib-first confirmed by Build. Tier-3 gate principle: the
  speed multiple will be set from first measurement against what is honestly achievable
  for a Python engine — if the honest number makes the gate theatre, Default raises it
  with Steven instead of quietly loosening it.
- 2026-10-30 (M2): M2 **accepted** — cold-clone reproduction (88 OK, syntax 46/46,
  behaviour 21/21); CHECK-error wording divergence independently confirmed against the
  pinned binary (`CHECK constraint failed: n > 0`). Conformance-spec + t1a corpus delivered
  by Research (untracked); corpus wiring + combined run ordered as the re-baseline step.
  Case format: Build's differential design adopted as the single format per Research's
  spec; Research owns the spec file, Build never edits normalization rules (decision 3).
- 2026-10-30 (re-baseline event #1): corpus grew 21 → 41 cases (Research's t1a, +20).
  Old score: behaviour 21/21 (100.0%), syntax 46/46. New: **35/41 (85.4%) behaviour**,
  syntax 46/46 unchanged. Six failures: 4 parser-message-text (M2.5), 2 SELECT-without-FROM
  (M10). Wiring executed by Default under delegated judgment (Build's harness commits
  f12cee8/f189d1d already carried the glob and as-is file commits; Default added the
  spec-required corpus-revision output and ran the cold-clone verification). Build reviews
  the Default-written runner addition next round.
- 2026-10-30 (M2.5): M2.5 **accepted** — cold-clone reproduction (94 tests OK, syntax
  46/46, behaviour 39/41). Default independently confirmed against the pinned binary:
  `SELECT 1e` → `unrecognized token: "1e"` (crash fixed), unterminated block comment
  accepted as comment-to-EOI (fix real; `SELECT 1 /*…` still fails only via the known
  FROM gap), bracket/backtick identifiers → `no such column: apple` without the hint,
  and ParseError.detail preserved alongside conformance wording. Build's nit on the
  5e62a3c commit message was correct — the diff carried spec + runner only, not t1a
  (Build's f12cee8 already had it); logged as a message-accuracy lesson, not corrected
  retroactively.
- 2026-10-30 (re-baseline event #2): t1a grew 20 → 22 cases (quote-style identifiers).
  Old score 39/41 (95.1%) at corpus f12cee8; new 41/43 (95.3%) at 1c24177. **Cases added,
  engine unchanged** — a score rise with zero code diff is corpus growth, recorded here
  so no reader mistakes it for progress. Both new cases pass on first run (Build had
  implemented the quote-style distinction at M2.5); the `-dirty` corpus-revision suffix
  was observed live on the uncommitted edit before commit — mechanism validated in the
  field, not just in tests.
- 2026-10-30 (CHECKPOINT 1): three milestones complete (M1 parser, M2 in-memory tables,
  M2.5 error wording). Score trajectory 35/41 → 39/41 (95.1%) behaviour, 46/46 syntax.
  Remaining known failures: 2 corpus cases (SELECT-without-FROM, M10) + features not yet
  reached (M8 joins, M10 expressions, M12 ordering, M16 constraints/DML, M17 affinity).
  Budget: 7 of 12 rounds. M3 (disk storage, B-tree) ordered on approval.
- 2026-10-30 (CHECKPOINT 1 approved): Steven approved ("just keep going"). M3 opened;
  round 1 = on-disk page-format decision (expensive to reverse). Research's spec
  amendments ratified as-is: `--sort`/`--reopen` directives roadmap (reopen lands with
  t1b, not mid-M3), crash-recovery and index-choice evidence is engineer-owned because
  the corpus cannot observe them (M4 rider: plan-level artifact required for any "index
  works" claim). No re-baseline — no normalization or scoring change in the spec edit.
- 2026-10-30 (budget warning, threshold 9): Tier-1 budget at 9 of 12 rounds. At the
  current pace (M3 ≈ 2 rounds, M4 ≈ 1) the cap lands during M4's review. Default will
  stop and ask Steven to top up the budget before spending round 12.
- 2026-10-30 (M3): M3 **accepted** — cold-clone reproduction (114 tests OK, syntax 46/46,
  behaviour 41/43, corpus revision unchanged at 1c24177 for engine-only commits).
  Default re-ran the durability tool: write/reopen sha256 identical, append persisted;
  **Default's additional probe: CHECK constraint still enforced after reopen** (violating
  insert fails with SQLite's wording), independently confirming the store-original-CREATE
  catalog design. Runner zero-diff claim verified (`git diff` across both commits empty).
  `Database(path)` signature change reported separately as required. Format doc read and
  ratified: page-0 header, B+tree with leftmost-pointer interior nodes, deliberately-
  absent table maps every gap to its owning milestone. M3 counted as ONE round per the
  new counting rule (milestone = one round regardless of commit count).
